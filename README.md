# An Overhaul Modpack by G̶H̶O̶S̶T̶

Hello, my name is G̶H̶O̶S̶T̶, and I'm thrilled to present Left 4 Dead 3: No Survivors, a modpack born from a deep passion for the Left 4 Dead universe. With over 650 hours logged on my Steam account, approximately 3500 hours on my Xbox 360 across L4D1 and L4D2 Versus mode, and tens of thousands of collective hours between my friends and me, you could say we're a little dedicated. /Not that we're that proud of our hour counts ;) 

This modpack is my love letter, a heartfelt answer to the question: "What if Valve did make L4D3? What would that look like?" I've poured countless hours into curating and integrating 351 unique items from the Steam Workshop to create a vision of Left 4 Dead's next generation. I've taken some creative liberties to truly elevate the horror and intensity. For instance, the Tank has been transformed into the terrifying Meatwall, a fantastic custom asset addon inspired by a scrapped Turtle Rock Studios concept. I've also reworked some of the Special Infected to be, in my humble opinion, truly horrifying. The Spirit Witch, a shadowy apparition with glowing red eyes and all-new sound effects, is one such example. The Jockey, too, becomes a rare boss known as "The Howler," complete with its own uniquely horrifying mechanics. Beyond these major changes, you'll find thousands of replaced sound effects, music cues, and other subtle yet impactful additions designed to drag Left 4 Dead kicking and screaming into the next generation.

## What is "Left 4 Dead 3: No Survivors"?

This modpack isn't just a collection of cosmetic changes; it's an ambitious attempt to redefine the gameplay, visuals, and audio of Left 4 Dead 2, transforming it into a fresh, immersive, and often terrifying new experience. Every element, from environmental details to infected behavior and survivor interactions, has been meticulously considered and enhanced.

---

## Key Features & Enhancements

"Left 4 Dead 3: No Survivors" focuses on several core areas to deliver its ambitious overhaul:

### Visual Fidelity & Immersion

Prepare for a visually stunning apocalypse. We've integrated a vast array of high-definition textures, enhanced lighting, and environmental effects to bring the world of Left 4 Dead to life like never before.

* **Massive Texture Overhaul:** Nearly every visual element has been upgraded. This includes 4K remastered skyboxes, detailed city skylines, HD textures for common props like concrete blocks, potted plants, and traffic cones, and even 4K retextures for vehicles like buses, police cars, and military transports. You'll notice the difference in everything from a rusty jerrycan to the intricate details of a Wurlitzer jukebox.
* **Enhanced Environmental Effects:** Experience more realistic and dynamic environments with Enhanced Water Reflections, Improved Lightning (now 2K resolution), and HD Fire & Smoke. The world feels more tangible and reactive.
* **Atmospheric Upgrades:** From Informal Skyboxes v2 that work with any color correction to Refractive Puddles and Enhanced Draw Distance, the modpack creates a deeply immersive atmosphere. You'll even find subtle touches like Improved-Safehouse Graffiti and a Red Junkjard Crane.
* **Attention to Detail:** Mods like "Damaged Outro" Fix for escape animations, Clean Flashlight, and 7 HD Potted Plants with Model RNG (Random Number Generation) show the meticulous effort to enhance even the smallest details.

### Reimagined Gameplay & AI

Beyond just looks, the modpack significantly alters how you play and how the infected behave.

* **Enhanced Infected Behavior:**
    * [VSCRIPT] Real Time Common Infected: Infected update continuously for more precise and relentless pursuit.
    * Improved Witch AI and Improved Tank AI [UPDATE 2.0]: These iconic special infected are more cunning and dangerous.
    * [VSCRIPT] Witch Multi-Hit: The Witch can now hit more than one player, a nod to pre-release mechanics.
    * Infected can disarm survivors: A new challenge where infected hits can knock your weapon to the ground.
    * Penetrable Riot zombie's Armor: Adjust how easily different weapons can penetrate the Riot zombie's armor.
    * No-Collide Commons on Blunt Melee script: Makes blunt melees more effective by disabling common infected collision after they die.
    * Super Hordes: For those seeking the ultimate challenge, prepare for waves of up to 400 infected, with decreased time between waves.
* **Survivor Mechanics & Quality of Life:**
    * Pain Pills Animation and Defibrillator Animation Redux: More realistic and fluid animations for medical items.
    * [xdR] RNG Survivor Incap Animations: Roughly 15 different incapacitation animations per survivor for varied reactions.
    * [xdR] Shotgun Reload Fixes & Tweaks: Addresses issues with reload sequences, including hearing other players reload shotguns.
    * Tactical Movement Speed: Survivor: Adjusts movement speed for a more tactical feel.
    * VScript Dynamic Survivor Flashlights: Flashlights from other players now illuminate the world.
    * Infinite Shoving: Removes the shoving cooldown, allowing for constant defensive action.
    * Use Grenades While Incapped: Adds the ability to use Pipe Bombs, Bile Jars, and Molotovs even when incapacitated.
    * [VSCRIPT] Increased Melee Swing Range: Improves melee combat, especially for players with higher ping.
    * Better Medkit (5 second use) and Quick Revive: Offers quicker healing and revival options.
    * Immersive Fall Damage: Fall damage will temporarily immobilize survivors, making falls more impactful.
    * Door Barge: Shove through doors while running for a more dynamic entry.
    * Killer Healer [100HP Limit]: Gain extra HP when killing special infected or bosses, up to a maximum of 100HP.
    * Limited Ammo Piles - Difficulty Based [N-PACK EDITION]: Ammo pile uses are now adjusted per difficulty (e.g., 4 uses on Easy, 1 on Expert).

### Audio & Soundscape Overhaul

The auditory experience is completely revamped to heighten tension and immersion.

* **Eerie Atmosphere & Sound FX [Part 1, 2, & 3]:** Replaces all in-game atmospheric audio with subtle, chilling ambience and new sound effects.
* **Horror Ambience & Hell Chant:** A dedicated mod to bring creepy, unsettling background noises and replace contagion/glimpse music, sampled from games like Doom 3 and Stalker.
* **Crunchy Bone Sound:** Replaces survivor neck crack/snapping sounds with samples from Doom Eternal.
* **Realistic Jet Sounds & Gas Station Explosion Sound Remake:** Overhauls specific environmental sounds for greater realism.
* **Banshee Witch Voice:** Replaces the Witch's sounds with the terrifying Banshee from Mass Effect 3.
* **Necromorph Common Infected Sounds:** Overhauls common infected sounds, aiming for a more genuinely horrifying experience.
* **Ping!, Clank!, Whoosh!!:** Adds satisfying audio cues for low ammo, magazine drops, and thrown pipebombs.
* **Shell Impact Sounds & Shoe Scuff Sounds:** Adds more realistic details to combat and movement.
* **Mute Special Infected Music:** Allows for a more suspenseful experience by muting the music cues for most special infected.
* **Near-Death SFX:** Muffles and reverbs sounds when you're black & white or nearly dying, adding a cinematic touch.

### Characters & Animation

Survivors and infected alike receive visual and animation updates for a more polished and engaging experience.

* **New Survivor & Infected Models:** Includes diverse character models such as TUNDRA Francis, Balkan Ellis, CODMW3 Juggernaut (Coach) Updated, Viper (Zoey), Kokoro - Tactical (Rochelle), and COMM: CSGO - 3rd Commando Compay KSK RETEXTURE [Nick].
* **Voice Overhauls:** Replace survivor voices with iconic characters like Wesker for Nick, Chris for Coach, and various Payday 2 characters (Dallas for Bill, Houston for Louis, Hoxton for Francis, Sydney for Zoey, Clover for Rochelle, Bodhi for Ellis). These include a significant number of lines, with over 2500 lines replaced for Clover (Rochelle).
* **Enhanced Animations:** Beyond the core reanimations, specific improvements include [xdR] Coach Stomp & Crawl Fix, [V-Script] E3 Style Upgrade Pickup Logic, [V-Script] Dual Pistol Pick-up Animation, and [V-Script] Draw Animation on Laser-Sight Pickup.
* **MW2019 Weapon Animations:** A huge collection of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2019 weapons are integrated with fully fixed and accurate game animations, sounds, and materials. This includes a wide arsenal from the .50 GS handgun to the M79 Grenade Launcher, and various melee weapons like the Fire Axe, Machete, Katana, and Shovel.

### UI & Quality of Life Features

The user interface also gets a fresh look and additional functionalities to enhance the overall experience.

* **HD Interface, HD Textures for UI:** Recreated UI elements with x4 increased texture size, ready for 4K displays.
* **[HUD] Slim HUD - Alternative:** A more minimalistic and less intrusive HUD option.

## Modpack Assembly & Compatibility

This collection is a testament to the creativity of the Left 4 Dead 2 community. Assembled by G̶H̶O̶S̶T̶, it incorporates the work of over 120 different creators, all meticulously chosen and integrated to work together as seamlessly as possible.

**Important Notes on Compatibility:**

* **Local Servers / Singleplayer Recommended:** Many of the advanced VScript mods, such as dynamic flashlights, real-time common infected, and advanced AI tweaks, only work if you are hosting a local server or playing in singleplayer. They will not function on dedicated servers where you are not the host.
* **`sv_consistency 0`:** The mod "NO MORE CONSISTENCY CHECK!" is included to automatically set `sv_consistency 0` on your hosted server, allowing other players to join with custom content without issues.
* **Potential Conflicts:** While every effort has been made to ensure compatibility, with 351 items, minor conflicts may arise. If you encounter unexpected behavior, refer to individual addon descriptions on the Workshop page for specific troubleshooting.
* **Performance:** Given the extensive visual and script-based enhancements, a capable system is recommended for the best experience. Some mods, like "+Ultra Particle: Texture files," are optimized to reduce FPS impact, but overall, this modpack is graphically intensive. Ensure your Page Pool Memory is set to LOW in your game settings to reduce crashes, especially with HD addons and skybox replacements.

## How to Get Started

You have two primary ways to install "Left 4 Dead 3: No Survivors":

### Option 1: 1-Click Installer (Recommended for Full Experience)

I've developed a **1-Click Installer** for a seamless setup, especially if you want all the performance benefits and custom content immediately. 

#### NOTE: YOU DO NOT HAVE TO USE THIS INSTALLER, but I highly recommend allowing addons to download from the Workshop. Launch the game, let the addons fully download (wait for the loading icon to disappear and the UI/music to change), then quit L4D2. Move all files from addons/workshop to addons/ in your L4D2 directory, and unsubscribe from Workshop items to prevent redownloading.

#### If you'd like to do this, but do not wish to mess with copying files, there's a button on the Installer "Already subscribed to the Collection? Click Here", which copies the files for you, and also installs my custom media pack (intro videos + main menu bg video replacement)

#### (THIS MAKES LOADING TIMES INSTANT AND PREVENTS A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES LIKE MODS NOT LOADING BEFORE STARTING A CAMPAIGN.)

**Understanding Storage Requirements:** This is a large modpack!

* The installer archive itself is roughly 12.8 GB.
* Once unzipped, the installer folder will also be around 12.8 GB.
* The full installed modpack content will occupy approximately 19.5 GB on the drive containing your Steam Library.
* Combining these, you could temporarily occupy up to 59 GB of storage during the installation process (12.8 GB archive + 12.8 GB unzipped installer + 19.5 GB final install + ~14 GB for stock L4D2).
* I highly recommend deleting the initial 12.8 GB archive after unzipping the installer as the installer folder already contains compressed addon archives. This will significantly reduce the maximum storage occupied.

**Installation Steps:**

1.  Download the 1-Click Installer. (Link will be provided separately, as it's a large file).
* [1-Click Installer MEGA.nz](https://tinyurl.com/l4d3nosurvivors)
* [1-Click Installer Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h817KDBSFHIv-cgcPG014DZSfFuHMgwt/view?usp=sharing)
3.  Unzip the installer archive.
4.  Launch the installer application.
5.  The installer should auto-detect your Left 4 Dead 2 directory. If not, click the folder icon and manually browse to `{SteamLibrary}/steamapps/common/Left 4 Dead 2/` (this is the folder that contains `left4dead2.exe` and the `left4dead2` folder).
6.  Click "Install."
7.  **IMPORTANT: Do not click anywhere or interact with your computer during the installation process.** The installer is programmatically unzipping large files and transferring them to your `/left4dead2/addons/` folder. Clicking can easily cause it to crash.
8.  If the installer crashes, simply restart it. It's designed to wipe your addons folders and start over clean.
9.  **Crucially, make sure you unsubscribe from any Left 4 Dead 2 addons you currently have subscribed to on the Steam Workshop.** This prevents the game from redownloading them and conflicting with the modpack.

The installer also includes custom music for the modpack by my friend's band, Riftwalker! You'll find a mute button and volume slider in the installer, defaulting to 20% volume and capping at 80% (for your ears!).

### Option 2: Steam Workshop Collection (with Installer Optimization)

You can still use the traditional Steam Workshop method, but I've integrated a way to optimize it for better performance using the installer.

1.  Subscribe to the "Left 4 Dead 3: No Survivors" collection on Steam Workshop.
2.  Launch Left 4 Dead 2. Allow the game to download all the addons. You'll know it's complete when the loading icon next to "Addons" disappears in the main menu, and the UI and music start changing.
3.  Quit Left 4 Dead 2.
4.  Launch the 1-Click Installer (downloaded and unzipped as in Option 1).
5.  Click the button that says "Subscribed to the collection already? Click here."
6.  This option will copy your downloaded addons from `/addons/workshop/` to just `/addons/`. Why do this?
    * It allows for MUCH faster loading times in Left 4 Dead 2, as the game doesn't need to load addons from the Workshop directory every time.
    * It will cut down on crashes.
    * It enables you to use the 1-Click Uninstaller for easy removal later.
7.  **IMPORTANT: After using this option, you MUST unsubscribe from ALL workshop addons for Left 4 Dead 2 on the Steam Workshop.** If you don't, Left 4 Dead 2 will attempt to re-download them, causing conflicts and potential issues.

## Custom Launch Options (Optional)

These launch options are **not strictly necessary** for the modpack to function, but they are highly recommended. They can significantly **improve performance, loading times, and enhance the overall visual fidelity** to complement the new graphical look of "Left 4 Dead 3: No Survivors".

To apply these:

1.  Open **Steam Library**.
2.  Right-click on **Left 4 Dead 2**.
3.  Select **"Properties."**
4.  In the "General" tab, find **"Launch Options."**
5.  Copy and paste the following string into the box:
    ```
    -widescreen -high -threads 8 +mat_queue_mode 2 +cl_forcepreload 1 +mat_hdr_level 2
    ```

Here's what each command does:

* `-widescreen`: Forces the game to launch in widescreen mode. Useful for modern monitors.
* `-high`: Tells your operating system to prioritize Left 4 Dead 2 with "high" CPU priority. This can help prevent stutters and improve responsiveness, especially on systems with many background processes.
* `-threads 8`: This command tells the Source engine how many CPU threads to utilize. **My recommendation is `8` as a common sweet spot for modern CPUs**.
    * **How to check your CPU thread count:**
        * **Windows:** Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc), go to the "Performance" tab, then click on "CPU." You'll see "Cores" and "Logical processors" (threads). Use the "Logical processors" count.
        * **Example:** A CPU might have 4 Cores but 8 Logical Processors (due to hyper-threading). You'd use `8`.
    * **Alternative Thread Counts:**
        * **Lower-end PCs (2-4 threads):** Try `-threads 2` or `-threads 4`.
        * **Higher-end PCs (12+ threads):** While your CPU might have more, the Source engine doesn't always scale perfectly beyond 8-12 threads. You can try `-threads 10`, `-threads 12`, or even `-threads 16`, but `8` is often sufficient and stable. Experiment to find what works best for your system.
* `+mat_queue_mode 2`: Enables multi-threaded rendering for the Material System. This can significantly improve performance by allowing the CPU to prepare render commands for the GPU in parallel, reducing CPU bottlenecking.
* `+cl_forcepreload 1`: Forces the client to preload all game assets (models, textures, sounds) before a map starts. This results in longer loading screens but virtually eliminates in-game stutters or hitches due to asset loading during gameplay.
* `+mat_hdr_level 2`: Sets the High Dynamic Range (HDR) lighting level to its highest quality. This dramatically enhances lighting and shadows, providing richer contrast and a more realistic, immersive visual experience that perfectly supports the modpack's graphical enhancements.
